# Window Clicker

Addicted to those mindless [clicking games](https://www.crazygames.com/game/clicker-heroes) as defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game)?

FREE yourself with THIS mindless clicker app.

Way back in the day of *Mafia Wars* (or any other mindless clicking game) there was Firefox and GreaseMonkey.
After about two weeks of "playing" Mafia Wars it got extremely tedious.
A bunch of us developers were going to write something that automated playing that game, but we didn't have to!
Somebody already had started putting together some GreaseMonkey scripts to do it.
Over the months that "app" got very elaborite with TONS of settings.
You could enter all of your settings and then ignore it for DAYS freeing up your time so you could actually get some work done. :)

I'm sure there are a few of these window clicking apps around to break these games.
Why do we play these crazy games? 
To beat our friends for bragging rights!
Although Mafia Wars was a team kind of thing.

## NOTE:
You can't really do much on your computer while this is running, because the mouse is technically moving to that spot and then moving back.
You can **try** and you may have some luck if the settings are adjusted correctly.

## Goals:

* Use the `DataContractJsonSerializer` to minimize the use of external NuGet packages
*(I prefer Newtownsoft, but this is just part of the exercise.)*

## Instructions

1. Compile and run the app.
2. Drag the window over the area you want to click.
3. Click the location to click.
4. Drag the app out of the way.
5. Press the "Click Screen" button.

You can dig into the code to see what the options are.
The options are so you don't get banned from the game and your friends don't beat you.

I actually **wrote** one of those clicker games a few years ago **[ClickR](https://github.com/SpilledMilkCOM/ClickR)**
So this app will help me beat me at my own game, AND allow you to **crush** your friends.

A little "white hack" to FREE up your time.

## WindowClicked  (Test App)
This project will display where the clicker has clicked.  This helps for multiple actions and tweaking the clicker code.
